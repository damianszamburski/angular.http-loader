# angular.http-loader


## Installation
Include the Javascript at the bottom of your page before the closing body tag:
```
<script src="path/js/angular-http-loader.min.js"></script>
```
Include module to your angular app:
```
.module('yourmodule', [..., 'angular.http-loader'])
```

## Usage
**The `$http` service:**

Available new property `loader` in config object:
```
$http({..., loader: "your_loader_name"});
```
Property:
* **loader** - `{string}` - Name of loader that will be observed.


**The `loader=""` directive:**

You can observe `$http` requests in view:
```
<div ng-loader="your_loader_name">...</div>
```
Observe more than one variable (eq.`loader="your_loader_name1 your_loader_name2"`).


When `$http` request is calling, the html element automaticly receives a html class `ajax-loading`, like that:
```
<div ng-loader="your_loader_name" class="ajax-loading">...</div>
```
If you want to show `ajax-loading` class when view was init, add `ng-loader-init=""` and set it to `true`, like that:
```
<div ng-loader="your_loader_name" ng-loader-init="true">...</div>
```


Directives:
* **ng-loader** - `string`
* **ng-loader-init** - `bool=true` (optional)
